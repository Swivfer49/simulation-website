  <h1>Simulation Showcase</h1>

  <p>The purpose of this website is to allow me to demonstrate different types of simulations in real-time. I have created a particle simulation, a raycast simulation and a game of life. I used Html, JavaScript, and Processing to create them. The goal of these simulations were to expand my knowledge and test my skills as I overcame obstacles to get these running. Click on the different boxes below to view them.</p>
